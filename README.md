# Introduction Python

For people that asked me some links to easily learn the basics of Python, please check the material from the following UniTN course: https://disi.unitn.it/~passerini/teaching/2021-2022/sci-pro/index.html. In particular, the material about "Complex statements"are really useful for our course (List Comprehension and the various loops).
